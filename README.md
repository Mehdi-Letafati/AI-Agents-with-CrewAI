In this repo, an agentic workflow is simulated for two AI Agents, using CrewAI. 
As a cutting-edge framework for orchestrating autonomous AI agents, it facilitates "collaborative intelligence" by programming agents to work together seamlessly, tackling complex tasks.  
The code configures AI agents with the ability to assume roles, define goals and tasks, as well as equipping them with LLM tools from OpenAI. 
This repo showcases a simple multi-agent research team with CrewAI as the backbone for the multi-agent interactions.


In another example, 'crewai_with_groq_llama70b.py', LLM agents are programmed with CrewAI as bakcbone with Llama3 70b! To efficiently run this large-size LLM, Groq API is utilized, which highlogts a superfast inference process, such that it can be easily run on local PCs as well!!!
